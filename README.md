PLEASE HELP!
# BrewHaHa
This is my "functioning" version of BrewSkies (formerly BrewHaHa)

This app has been built with Javascript, Node.js, React.js, Strapi, MongoDB, and MLab

I am struggling to find a way to get it hosted right now due to the nature of my stack. 

I have been unsuccessful in getting it hosted on Heroku and Netlify because it's full stack (I think thats why anyway).

I have been able to get my API hosted pseudo-successfully on Heroku, but when I was able to do that,
I only had a generic Strapi Admin page render for me.

I can't for the life of me figure out how to get the front and back end up and communucating (when hosted online).

I don't have any problem when I have the app running locally using the following build commands:
-cd server
-strapi start
-cd client
-npm start

Those commands get my site functioning well enough, though I still need to figure out
a way to get Update and Delete commands working with the server, but that's a lesser issue for me right now
compared to getting the site hosted in general.

ANY AND ALL INSIGHT IS WELCOME!
